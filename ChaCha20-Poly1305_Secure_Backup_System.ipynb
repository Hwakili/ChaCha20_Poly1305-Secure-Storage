# Task 2: Secure Backup System using ChaCha20-Poly1305

**Module:** Cryptography and Applications  
**Task:** Cryptographic Implementation (Secure Storage)  

## Overview
This notebook implements a secure backup solution that encrypts files and folders,
supports multiple users with independent keys, and enforces confidentiality,
integrity, and authenticity using modern cryptographic primitives.

The design follows a hybrid encryption model (KEM/DEM) and demonstrates:
- Authenticated encryption (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Secure key management and sharing
- Digital signatures
- Tamper detection
